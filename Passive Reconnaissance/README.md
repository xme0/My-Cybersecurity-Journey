# What is Passive Reconnaissance?
Passive Reconnaissance is the process of gathering information without interacting directly with the target system, using only publicly accessible data sources.
# What is Data Collected ?
1. email addresses, phone numbers, IP addresses, domain names, suppliers, deployed technologies, geographic locations and social networking accounts. Cybercriminals can find most of this data by using search engines such as Google via Google Dorking.
2. what type of computers are being used, what operating systems are running, which software has been installed, an application's programming language and similar details.
3. physical searches to get at sensitive information. This might include digging through trash or looking for data stored on discarded computers.
